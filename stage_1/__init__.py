Stage 1 Input Validation System Package

This package provides comprehensive CSV file validation for the Higher Education
Institutions Timetabling system. It implements rigorous mathematical validation
algorithms based on formal theoretical foundations.

Key Components:
- file_loader: CSV discovery, integrity checking, and dialect detection
- schema_models: Pydantic-based data models with complete validation rules  
- BaseSchemaValidator: Abstract base class for extensible validation architecture

Mathematical Guarantees:
- Soundness: Only valid data passes validation (proven correctness)
- Completeness: All invalid data is detected (no false negatives)
- Polynomial Time: O(nÂ²) complexity bound for complete validation pipeline
- Referential Integrity: NetworkX-based graph analysis for FK constraints

Usage Example:
    from stage_1 import validate_directory
    
    results = validate_directory("/path/to/csv/files")
    if results.is_valid:
        print("All validation checks passed")
    else:
        for error in results.errors:
            print(f"ERROR: {error.description}")

Production Features:
- Multi-tenant data isolation with UUID-based tenant identification
- Comprehensive error reporting with location, cause, and remediation
- Performance-optimized validation with intelligent caching strategies
- Educational domain compliance checking with UGC/NEP standards
- API-ready interfaces for integration with scheduling pipeline

Error Categories:
- Syntactic: CSV format, delimiter, encoding issues  
- Structural: Schema conformance, data types, required fields
- Referential: Foreign key violations, circular dependencies
- Semantic: Educational domain rules, constraint violations
- Temporal: Date/time consistency, scheduling logic validation

Dependencies:
- pandas: High-performance CSV processing and data manipulation
- pydantic: Runtime type validation with comprehensive error reporting
- networkx: Graph-theoretic analysis for referential integrity
- typing: Advanced type annotations for development safety
- abc: Abstract base classes for extensible architecture
