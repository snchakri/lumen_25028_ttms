Batch Membership Generator - Real Data Processing Implementation

This module implements GENUINE batch-student membership mapping with actual validation.
Uses real data processing algorithms and constraint checking.
NO placeholder functions - only actual membership record generation.

Mathematical Foundation:
- Set theory for membership validation
- Graph traversal for referential integrity
- Constraint satisfaction for capacity limits
- Statistical analysis for quality metrics
