## 1. Introduction and Theoretical Motivation

The PuLP (Python Linear Programming) framework provides a unified interface to multiple optimization solvers, each employing distinct algorithmic strategies for solving mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in educational scheduling. This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how compiled educational data is transformed into optimization models, processed by different solvers using their specific strategies, and converted into actionable scheduling solutions.

The solver family includes five primary engines:
1. **CBC (COIN-OR Branch and Cut)**
2. **GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)**  
3. **HiGHS (High Performance Linear Programming)**
4. **CLP (COIN-OR Linear Programming)**
5. **Symphony (COIN-OR Mixed-Integer Programming)**

Each solver implements different algorithmic paradigms with unique strengths for various problem classes.

The aim is to present formal mathematical models that capture the essential characteristics of data transformation, optimization processes, and solution extraction, providing theoretical guarantees for correctness, optimality, and computational efficiency.

## 2. Universal Problem Formulation

### 2.1 Timetabling / Scheduling MILP Model

**Definition 2.1 (Scheduling MILP).** The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program:

minimize c^T x + d^T y                                                    (1)

subject to:
Ax + By ≤ b                                                              (2)
Ex + Fy = h                                                              (3)
x ≥ 0, x ∈ ℝ^n                                                           (4)
y ∈ {0, 1}^m                                                             (5)

where x are continuous variables, y are binary variables, and constraint matrices represent scheduling requirements.

### 2.2 Input Data Model Formalization

**Definition 2.2 (Compiled Data Structure).** The compiled data model is a formal structure:

D = (E, V, C, O, P)

where:
- E = {E_course, E_faculty, E_room, E_time, E_batch} are entity sets
- V : E → ℝ^{n_e} assigns variable vectors to entities
- C = C_hard ∪ C_soft are constraint specifications
- O : V → ℝ defines objective function components
- P contains solver-specific parameters and preferences

**Definition 2.3 (Variable Assignment Encoding).** Scheduling variables are encoded as:

x_{c,f,r,t,b} ∈ {0, 1} : assignment of course c to faculty f, room r, time t, batch b

with auxiliary continuous variables for resource utilization and preference satisfaction.

### 2.3 Constraint Classification

**Definition 2.4 (Hard Constraints).** Hard constraints C_hard include:

∑_{f,r,t,b} x_{c,f,r,t,b} = 1    ∀c ∈ Courses     (Course Assignment)

∑_{c,r,b} x_{c,f,r,t,b} ≤ 1     ∀f, t            (Faculty Conflict)

∑_{c,f,b} x_{c,f,r,t,b} ≤ 1     ∀r, t            (Room Conflict)

∑_{c,f,r,t} x_{c,f,r,t,b} ≤ capacity_b  ∀b       (Batch Capacity)

**Definition 2.5 (Soft Constraints).** Soft constraints C_soft are incorporated through penalty terms in the objective function:

minimize ∑_i w_i · violation_i

where w_i are penalty weights and violation_i measure constraint violations.

## 3. Solver-Specific Theoretical Analysis

### 3.1 CBC (COIN-OR Branch and Cut)

#### 3.1.1 Algorithmic Foundation

**Definition 3.1 (CBC Branch-and-Bound Tree).** CBC constructs a search tree T = (V, E) where:
- Each node v ∈ V represents a subproblem with additional constraints
- Root node corresponds to LP relaxation of original MILP
- Leaf nodes are either infeasible, integral, or pruned by bounds

**Theorem 3.2 (CBC Optimality Guarantee).** CBC finds the optimal solution if one exists, with finite termination for bounded integer programs.

**Proof.** CBC employs systematic branching on fractional variables, creating a finite search tree due to bounded integer domains. The branch-and-bound framework maintains global lower and upper bounds, ensuring optimality when bounds converge or all nodes are explored.

Cutting planes strengthen the linear relaxation, potentially reducing the search space without eliminating optimal solutions. The algorithm terminates with optimal solution when no fractional solutions remain in unexplored nodes.

#### 3.1.2 Solution Strategy

**Algorithm 3.3 (CBC Solution Process).** CBC follows this formal procedure:

```
1. Preprocessing: Reduce problem size through constraint elimination and variable fixing
2. Root LP Relaxation: Solve continuous relaxation using dual simplex method
3. Cut Generation: Add valid inequalities (Gomory cuts, clique cuts, knapsack cuts)
4. Branching: Select fractional variable using strong branching heuristics
5. Node Processing: Apply best-first or depth-first search strategy
6. Pruning: Eliminate nodes with bounds worse than incumbent solution
7. Termination: Return optimal solution when search tree is exhausted
```

**Definition 3.4 (CBC Performance Characteristics).** For scheduling instances with n variables and m constraints:
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^p · poly(n, m)) where p is number of integer variables
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m + tree size)
- **Solution Quality**: Globally optimal for feasible instances

### 3.2 GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)

#### 3.2.1 Algorithmic Foundation

**Definition 3.5 (GLPK Dual Simplex Method).** GLPK primarily uses the dual simplex algorithm for LP relaxations:

max{b^T π : A^T π ≤ c, π ≥ 0}

maintaining dual feasibility while iterating toward primal feasibility.

**Theorem 3.6 (GLPK Convergence Properties).** The dual simplex method in GLPK converges to optimal solution in finite steps for non-degenerate problems.

**Proof.** Each dual simplex iteration improves the objective value or maintains it while resolving infeasibility. The finite number of bases ensures finite termination. Anti-cycling rules (Bland's rule) prevent infinite cycling in degenerate cases.

#### 3.2.2 Integer Programming Strategy

**Algorithm 3.7 (GLPK Branch-and-Bound).** GLPK implements branch-and-bound with specific features:

```
1. LP Solver: Dual simplex with crash basis and scaling
2. Branching Rules: Most fractional variable or user-defined priorities
3. Node Selection: Best-first search with backtracking
4. Preprocessing: Constraint aggregation and coefficient reduction
5. Heuristics: Simple rounding and local search procedures
```

**Definition 3.8 (GLPK Performance Profile).** GLPK characteristics for educational scheduling:
- **Strength**: Robust performance on moderately-sized instances
- **Time Complexity**: Polynomial for LP, exponential worst-case for MILP
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient sparse matrix representations
- **Reliability**: High numerical stability and accurate solutions

### 3.3 HiGHS (High Performance Linear Programming)

#### 3.3.1 Algorithmic Innovation

**Definition 3.9 (HiGHS Dual Revised Simplex).** HiGHS implements an advanced dual revised simplex method with:
- Parallel PAMI (Parallel Augmented Modified Invert) for basis updates
- Efficient sparse linear algebra with numerical stability
- Advanced pricing strategies for large-scale problems

**Theorem 3.10 (HiGHS Computational Efficiency).** HiGHS achieves superior performance through optimized linear algebra and parallel computation.

**Proof.** The parallel PAMI algorithm reduces basis update complexity from O(m^2) to O(m) amortized time through efficient spike decomposition and parallel processing. Advanced pricing strategies minimize the number of simplex iterations through better entering variable selection.

#### 3.3.2 Mixed-Integer Strategy

**Algorithm 3.11 (HiGHS Branch-and-Bound Enhancement).** HiGHS enhances standard branch-and-bound:

```
1. Presolving: Advanced constraint elimination and variable bound tightening
2. Cutting Planes: Sophisticated cut selection and management
3. Primal Heuristics: Diving and local search techniques
4. Parallel Processing: Multi-threaded node processing
5. Memory Management: Efficient tree storage and pruning
```

**Definition 3.12 (HiGHS Performance Advantages).** For scheduling optimization:
- **Speed**: Fastest LP solver with parallel capabilities
- **Scalability**: Handles large instances efficiently
- **Robustness**: Numerical stability with exact arithmetic options
- **Modern Design**: Optimized for contemporary hardware architectures

### 3.4 CLP (COIN-OR Linear Programming)

#### 3.4.1 Theoretical Foundation

**Definition 3.13 (CLP Primal-Dual Framework).** CLP implements both primal and dual simplex methods with automatic method selection:

Method = argmin{iterations_primal, iterations_dual}

**Theorem 3.14 (CLP Adaptive Strategy Optimality).** CLP's adaptive strategy minimizes expected solution time through dynamic method selection.

**Proof.** By maintaining both primal and dual simplex implementations, CLP can exploit problem structure. For problems with more constraints than variables, dual simplex typically requires fewer iterations. For problems with many variables, primal simplex may be more efficient. The adaptive selection minimizes expected computational cost.

#### 3.4.2 Specialized Features

**Algorithm 3.15 (CLP Solution Process).** CLP's approach includes:

```
1. Problem Analysis: Determine optimal solving method based on structure
2. Scaling: Numerical scaling for improved stability
3. Crash Basis: Advanced initial basis construction
4. Iteration: Primal or dual simplex with anti-cycling
5. Optimization: Post-optimal analysis and sensitivity information
```

**Definition 3.16 (CLP Specialization).** CLP focuses on:
- **LP Optimization**: Pure linear programming without integer constraints
- **Numerical Accuracy**: High-precision arithmetic and stability
- **Interface Flexibility**: Multiple input formats and API options
- **Educational Value**: Clear implementation suitable for learning

### 3.5 Symphony (COIN-OR Mixed-Integer Programming)

#### 3.5.1 Parallel Architecture

**Definition 3.17 (Symphony Distributed Framework).** Symphony implements a distributed branch-and-bound algorithm:

T_global = ∑_{p=1}^P T_p

where T_p is the subtree processed by processor p.

**Theorem 3.18 (Symphony Parallel Efficiency).** Symphony achieves near-linear speedup for problems with sufficient parallel granularity.

**Proof.** The distributed tree maintains load balancing through dynamic node redistribution. Communication overhead is minimized by local node processing and periodic global bound updates. For problems where node processing time dominates communication time, linear speedup is achievable.

#### 3.5.2 Advanced MILP Techniques

**Algorithm 3.19 (Symphony Enhanced Branch-and-Bound).** Symphony incorporates:

```
1. Parallel Tree Search: Multiple processors explore different tree regions
2. Cut Generation: Parallel cut separation and pool management
3. Primal Heuristics: Distributed heuristic execution
4. Load Balancing: Dynamic work redistribution among processors
5. Global Bounds: Coordinated bound updates across processors
```

**Definition 3.20 (Symphony Parallel Performance).** Symphony characteristics:
- **Scalability**: Linear speedup up to communication bottlenecks
- **Robustness**: Fault tolerance and processor failure recovery
- **Flexibility**: Configurable parallel strategies
- **Large-Scale**: Optimal for computationally intensive instances

## 4. Output Model Formalization

### 4.1 Solution Structure

**Definition 4.1 (Optimal Solution Representation).** The optimal solution is structured as:

S* = (x*, y*, z*, M)

where:
- x* are optimal continuous variable values
- y* are optimal binary variable values
- z* is the optimal objective value
- M contains solution metadata and solver information

### 4.2 Timetable / Schedule Generation

**Definition 4.2 (Schedule Construction Function).** The schedule construction function maps optimization solution to timetable:

φ : S* → T_schedule

where T_schedule represents the final timetable structure.

**Algorithm 4.3 (Schedule Construction Process).** From optimal solution to timetable:

```
1. Assignment Extraction: Identify x_{c,f,r,t,b} = 1 for course assignments
2. Conflict Resolution: Verify no constraint violations in final schedule
3. Quality Assessment: Calculate objective components and satisfaction metrics
4. Format Generation: Convert to required timetable format
5. Validation: Ensure educational domain compliance
```

## 5. Solver Selection Strategy

### 5.1 Problem Characterization

**Definition 5.1 (Problem Classification Function).** Scheduling instances are classified by:

Class(I) = f(|V|, |C|, ρ_integer, σ_constraint)

where ρ_integer is the integer variable ratio and σ_constraint measures constraint complexity.

### 5.2 Solver Recommendation Framework

**Definition 5.2 (Solver Selection Mapping).** The optimal solver selection function:

Solver*(I) = argmin_{s ∈ {CBC, GLPK, HiGHS, CLP, Symphony}} E[Time_s(I)]

based on expected solution time for instance characteristics.

## 6. Performance Analysis and Complexity

### 6.1 Theoretical Complexity Bounds

**Theorem 6.1 (Universal Complexity Bounds).** For scheduling MILP with n variables and m constraints:
- **LP Relaxation**: O(n³) using interior point methods
- **MILP (worst-case)**: O(2^p · poly(n, m)) where p is integer variables
- **MILP (average-case)**: O(poly(n, m)) for structured instances

**Proof.** LP complexity follows from interior point method analysis. MILP worst-case complexity comes from exhaustive enumeration of integer variable combinations. Average-case performance for scheduling benefits from problem structure and effective preprocessing.

### 6.2 Empirical Performance Characterization

**Definition 6.2 (Solver Performance Profile).** Each solver's performance is characterized by:

P_s(τ) = Pr[SolutionTime_s ≤ τ · MinTime]

representing the probability of solving within τ times the fastest solver time.

**Theorem 6.3 (Performance Ranking Stability).** For scheduling instances, performance rankings remain stable across problem sizes within complexity classes.

**Proof.** Scheduling exhibits consistent structural properties across institution sizes. Solver algorithmic advantages translate consistently across this problem class, leading to stable performance rankings within complexity bounds.

## 7. Solution Quality and Optimality

### 7.1 Optimality Verification

**Definition 7.1 (Solution Optimality Certificate).** A solution optimality certificate includes:
- Dual solution π* satisfying complementary slackness
- Reduced costs r* = c - A^T π*
- Optimality gap ε = |z* - z_bound|

**Theorem 7.2 (Strong Duality for Educational Scheduling).** For feasible scheduling MILP instances, strong duality holds at optimality.

**Proof.** Scheduling-engine's MILP satisfies standard regularity conditions (bounded feasible region, finite optimal value). By the fundamental theorem of linear programming extended to MILP, strong duality ensures that primal and dual optimal values coincide, providing optimality certificates.

### 7.2 Solution Robustness Analysis

**Definition 7.3 (Solution Stability Measure).** Solution stability under parameter perturbations:

Stability(δ) = Pr[SolutionValid(S*, I + δ)]

where δ represents small instance perturbations.

**Theorem 7.4 (Schedule Robustness).** Optimal schedules exhibit high stability under typical institutional parameter changes.

**Proof.** Scheduling constraints are predominantly structural (assignment, conflict avoidance) rather than parametric. Small changes in preferences, capacities, or availability typically require only local schedule adjustments, preserving global solution structure and feasibility.

## 8. Integration with Scheduling Pipeline

### 8.1 Data Flow Architecture

**Definition 8.1 (Pipeline Integration Model).** The solver integration follows:

Pipeline : D_compiled --Transform--> M_MILP --Solve--> S* --Extract--> T_schedule

### 8.2 Error Handling and Recovery

**Algorithm 8.2 (Solver Failure Recovery).** Robust solving process:

```
1. Primary Solve: Attempt solution with recommended solver
2. Failure Detection: Monitor timeout, memory limits, numerical issues
3. Fallback Strategy: Switch to alternative solver with different parameters
4. Relaxation: Gradually relax constraints if no feasible solution found
5. Heuristic Solution: Generate approximate solution if optimization fails
```

## 9. Advanced Solver Features

### 9.1 Warm Start Capabilities

**Definition 9.1 (Warm Start Solution).** A warm start solution provides initial values:

W = (x₀, y₀, B₀)

where B₀ is an initial basis for improved solver performance.

**Theorem 9.2 (Warm Start Performance Improvement).** Warm start solutions reduce average solution time by utilizing problem structure from previous solutions.

**Proof.** Scheduling often requires solving similar instances with minor modifications. Previous optimal solutions provide excellent starting points, reducing the number of simplex iterations and branch-and-bound nodes required for convergence.

### 9.2 Parameter Tuning Framework

**Definition 9.3 (Solver Parameter Optimization).** Optimal parameter selection:

θ* = argmin_θ E[SolutionTime(θ, I)]

where θ represents solver-specific parameters.

- **GLPK**: Traditional branch-and-bound with dual simplex LP solver
- **HiGHS**: High-performance linear algebra with parallel capabilities
- **CLP**: Specialized linear programming with adaptive method selection
- **Symphony**: Distributed computing with parallel branch-and-bound

### 10.2 Performance Trade-off Analysis

**Theorem 10.2 (No Universal Best Solver).** No single solver dominates all others across all scheduling instance types.

**Proof.** Different algorithmic approaches excel on different problem characteristics:
- Large LP relaxation gaps favor cutting plane methods (CBC)
- High constraint density benefits from advanced linear algebra (HiGHS)
- Parallel computational resources enable distributed approaches (Symphony)
- Pure LP subproblems benefit from specialized solvers (CLP)

This diversity necessitates intelligent solver selection based on instance characteristics.

## 11. Numerical Considerations

### 11.1 Numerical Stability Analysis

**Definition 11.1 (Condition Number Impact).** The condition number of constraint matrix A affects solver numerical stability:

κ(A) = |A| · |A⁻¹|

**Theorem 11.2 (Scheduling Numerical Properties).** Scheduling-engine's matrices exhibit favorable numerical properties due to their sparse, structured nature.

**Proof.** Scheduling constraint matrices are predominantly binary with simple coefficients (0, 1, -1). This structure results in well-conditioned systems with low condition numbers, ensuring numerical stability across all solver implementations.

### 11.2 Precision and Accuracy Guarantees

**Definition 11.3 (Solution Accuracy Bounds).** Solver accuracy is bounded by:

|Ax* - b| ≤ ε_feasibility
|c^T x* - z*| ≤ ε_optimality

where ε values represent solver tolerances.
