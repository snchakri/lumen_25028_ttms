"""
Migration Topology Module for PyGMO Archipelago

Implements migration strategies and topologies as per Section 5.2 of the foundational framework.

Supported topologies:
- Fully connected (all-to-all)
- Ring (circular)
- Star (hub-and-spoke)
- Small-world (Watts-Strogatz, as per Theorem 5.2)

Migration policies:
- Best individuals (elite migration)
- Random selection
- Crowding distance-based (diversity preservation)
